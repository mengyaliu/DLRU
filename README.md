Deep Learning Restful interface Utilities

This project will share some example utilities for people who want to create restful web services providing deep learning algorithm calls.
For example, an API named "http://localhost:8080/api/v1/face/detect/jpg" can be visited by a POST method with a JPEG file as payload, then JSON format results will be replied.
